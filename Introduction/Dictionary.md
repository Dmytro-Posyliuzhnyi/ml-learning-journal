### Feature vector

A **feature vector** is an ordered list of numerical values that represent the characteristics or properties (features) of an example in a dataset. Each value corresponds to a specific feature, and together, the vector provides a mathematical representation of the example that machine learning algorithms can process.

#### Example:

Imagine you are building a model to predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes. Each person in your dataset is represented by a feature vector:

| Feature                  | Value   |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Age (in years)           | 45      |
| Body Mass Index (BMI)    | 28.5    |
| Glucose Level (mg/dL)    | 120     |
| Exercise Hours per Week  | 3       |

The feature vector for this individual would be:

$`x_i = [45, 28.5, 120, 3]`$

So basically the feature vector in our case is just 4-dimensional vector, which is treated as point in a high-dimensional space.

Feature vectors provide a standardized way to represent data points so that machine learning models can analyze and learn patterns from them.
